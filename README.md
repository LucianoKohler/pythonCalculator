# Python Calculator
A simple project using the TKinter module to create a graphic representation of a calculator.

# How to run
- Make sure you have Python installed on your computer
  - You can do that by typing `python --version`
  - If you don't get a return, go to python.org to install is! It's cool!
- Download or clone the project via the Github's repository
- Open your command prompt and use the `cd` command to enter the directory where you installed the calculator
- run `python calculator.py` (or `py calculator.py`)
- Hope you enjoy it!
